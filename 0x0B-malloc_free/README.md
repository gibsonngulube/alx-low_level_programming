C - malloc, free

This repository contains my solutions to various problems related to dynamic memory allocation in C programming language. The focus of these problems is on the usage of the malloc and free functions to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically.

 Getting Started

 To get started with these problems, you need to have a basic understanding of the C programming language and its concepts, particularly pointers and memory management.

 Prerequisites

 You need to have a C compiler installed on your system. If you are using Linux, you can use the gcc compiler. If you are using Windows, you can use the MinGW or Cygwin compilers.

 Installing

 To get started, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


 git clone https://github.com/<username>/C-malloc-free.git

 Running the Programs

 Each problem in this repository has its own folder containing a C file with the solution. To run the program for a particular problem, navigate to the folder for that problem and run the following command:


 gcc <filename>.c -o <filename> ./<filename>
