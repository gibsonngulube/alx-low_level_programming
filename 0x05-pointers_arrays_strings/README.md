1. Pointers, Arrays, and Strings.

This repository contains solutions to tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings. Each task has its own source code file with a descriptive name. The solutions are written in C and are tested for correctness.

2. Getting Started

To get started, you need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:


git clone https://github.com/gibsonngulube/alx-low_level_programming/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings.git

3. Prerequisites

You need to have a C compiler installed on your machine to run the solutions. Additionally, you should have basic knowledge of pointers, arrays, and strings.

4. Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, navigate to the directory containing the source code files and run the command:


gcc filename.c -o executable-name

And then:

./filename

Replace <filename> with the actual name of the source file to run the program for your specific programming language.
