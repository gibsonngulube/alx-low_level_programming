C-Recursion

This project contains solutions for several tasks on recursion in the C programming language. The tasks include:

1. Printing a string, followed by a new line.
2. Printing a string in reverse.
3. Finding the length of a string.
4. Computing the factorial of a given number.
5. Computing the value of x raised to the power of y.
6. Finding the natural square root of a number.
7. Checking if a given integer is a prime number.
8. Checking if a string is a palindrome.
9. Comparing two strings for equality.

Each task has its own function, implemented using recursive algorithms. Recursion is a powerful technique for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

The code for each function is well-commented for clarity, and has been tested and verified to produce correct results.

By completing these tasks, I've gained a deeper understanding of recursion and how it can be used to solve a variety of problems.

This project is intended for educational purposes only and is not intended for use in production environments.

Enjoy exploring the world of recursion with C!
